# MayaBlazar
A simple 3D model of a blazar in Maya for use in the Adler's 2018 Fall Kavli Lecture.

A brief walk-through:

* Created polygons for the shapes
* Gave each it's own unique material name (replaced the lambert default with another lambert so that I could rename it).
* In the v2 files, I deform the elements with various textures (following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq9VYGpnkh4) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4f6djBtnA0) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdvHYnt10zI) and [this](https://vimeo.com/164069049)).
